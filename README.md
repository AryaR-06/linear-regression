# Linear Regression from Scratch

## **Project Overview**
This project implements **basic linear regression from scratch** using Python, providing a clear explanation of the underlying theory and mathematical concepts. It offers a practical demonstration of how linear regression works, emphasizing educational value and transparency in algorithmic design.

While libraries like `scikit-learn` make linear regression quick and efficient, this implementation focuses on manually coding the algorithm to gain deeper insights into its workings. The project also includes a comparison with `scikit-learn`'s `LinearRegression` model to highlight differences in performance and ease of use.
